## Receive with Trails

Receive mode makes it easy to generate payment requests and QR codes that others can scan with a wallet. You can specify a fixed amount or let the payer choose.

## Examples

### Fixed Amount QR Payment

```tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

export const FixedQRPayment = () => {
  return (
    <TrailsWidget
      apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
      mode="receive"
      toAddress="0x97c4A952b46bEcaD0663f76357d3776ba11566E1" // Your address
      toAmount="25"
      toChainId={8453} // Base
      toToken="USDC"
      onCheckoutComplete={({ sessionId }) => {
        console.log('Payment received:', sessionId)
      }}
    >
      <button className="qr-button">Show QR - Request 25 USDC</button>
    </TrailsWidget>
  )
}
```

### Flexible Amount QR Payment

Allow the payer to choose how much to send:

```tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

export const FlexibleQRPayment = () => {
  return (
    <TrailsWidget
      apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
      mode="receive"
      toAddress="0x97c4A952b46bEcaD0663f76357d3776ba11566E1"
      toChainId={8453}
      toToken="USDC"
    >
      <button className="qr-button">Generate Payment QR</button>
    </TrailsWidget>
  )
}
```

## Tips

- Ensure your displayed address is correct for settlement.
- If you want to suggest a token or chain, pass `toToken` and `toChainId`.
- Use `theme` and `customCss` to match your brand.
