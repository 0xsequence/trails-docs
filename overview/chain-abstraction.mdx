## Universal User Liquidity

Current user wallet balances are fragmented across multiple chains, wallets, tokens. Not only is this cumbersome from a user experience perspective to manage where funds are held, this also limits the buying power on applications for any given payment as a user can only use the funds on a single source chain at any time.

In contrast, Trails is a chain abstraction solution that simplifies the complexity of interacting with multiple blockchains from both developers and end users. This creates a unified experience for apps that enables users to pay with any token on any chain unlocking their full purchasing power.

### Traditional Cross-Chain

In traditional cross-chain interactions, users:

- Manage multiple wallets, gas tokens, and bridge separately for a payment
- Understand bridging protocols and wait times
- Handle transaction failures across different chains
- Navigate complex user interfaces for each blockchain

The standard cross-chain experience requires users to be aware of and manage multiple blockchain networks, each with their own tokens, interfaces, and complexities which significantly increases complexity.

### Chain Abstraction

Trails is a chain abstraction solution that eliminates these complexities by:

- **Universal Buying Power**: Applications can enable users to pay in every token from every chain for any arbitrary payment, i.e., an NFT costs 60 USDC on Base, a user can purchase it using 30 USDC on Optimism and 30 Arbitrum seamlessly.
- **Unified User Interface**: Single point of interaction across all chains. All app interactions can funnel through Trails to simplify flows.
- **Pay Gas in More Tokens**: Users don't need to hold specific gas tokens to interact across chains, any permit-compatible token can be used for end to end transactions.
- **Failure Recovery**: Built-in mechanisms to handle and recover from failed transactions

With chain abstraction, users interact with a unified layer that automatically handles all the underlying blockchain complexity with simple integration with Trails in their application.


## Unifying the Modular Ecosystem

Chain abstraction through Trails realizes the vision of modular blockchain networks, by unifying fragmented liquidity, enhancing buying power for users, and simplifying integration across networks.

By simplifying the transaction process and removing the need for users to manually manage assets across different chains, Trails significantly reduces friction, which can lead to lower churn and higher transaction volume.
