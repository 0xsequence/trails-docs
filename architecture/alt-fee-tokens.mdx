## Pay Gas with non-native tokens

Trails is able to support paying gas in any permit-compatible (EIP-2612) token which includes popular options and many stablecoins such as USDC and USDT.

This prevents such scenarios when bridging to a new chain and not having any gas tokens to actually interact with apps. Additionally, Trails is able to bring more utility for your token seamlessly by enabling it as a end to end payment & gas option.

During the Trails flow, a user will be by default prompted with the native gas token, however can select other options. This will initially require an approval for the token, then every subsequent transaction will be a single confirmation.
