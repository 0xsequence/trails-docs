## Overview

Trails supports paying gas fees in any permit-compatible (EIP-2612) token, including popular stablecoins like USDC and USDT. This removes the friction of needing native tokens on each chain.

## Why This Matters

Common problems this solves:

- **New chain onboarding**: Users bridge to a new chain but have no native tokens for gas
- **Stablecoin-first users**: Users who hold primarily stablecoins don't need to manage gas tokens
- **Simplified UX**: One token type for both payment and gas fees

## How It Works

1. User initiates a transaction in the Trails widget
2. By default, native gas token is shown as the fee option
3. User can select alternative fee tokens (USDC, USDT, etc.)
4. First time: User signs an EIP-2612 permit (gasless signature)
5. Subsequent transactions: Single confirmation only

## Supported Fee Tokens

Any token implementing EIP-2612 (permit) can be used as a fee token. 

See the [API Integration Guide](/api-reference/introduction) for the complete permit flow implementation at an API level.

## Widget Behavior

In the Trails widget, alternative fee tokens are automatically presented to users when available. No additional configuration is required—the widget handles permit signatures and fee selection automatically.
