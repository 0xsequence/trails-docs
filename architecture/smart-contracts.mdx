## Overview

Trails is built on a robust set of smart contracts deployed across multiple chains. All contracts are deployed via ERC-2470 Singleton Factory for deterministic addresses, ensuring consistency across the ecosystem.

## Contracts Repository

The complete source code for all Trails smart contracts is available on GitHub:

### Key Contracts

The Trails protocol consists of several core smart contracts:

- **TrailsRouter** - Main routing contract for intent execution and token operations
- **TrailsIntentEntrypoint** - Entry point for intent deposits with permit support
- **TrailsRouterShim** - Execution wrapper with sentinel tracking for success/failure states

All contracts leverage Sequence v3 account abstraction for flexible, secure cross-chain operations.

## Security Audits

Security is a top priority for Trails. All smart contracts have undergone comprehensive third-party security audits and public code4rena bounty competitions:
