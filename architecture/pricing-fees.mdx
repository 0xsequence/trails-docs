## Overview

Trails is **free to integrate** for any application. There are no setup fees, monthly costs, or integration charges. All fees are paid by the end-user at transaction time and are transparently displayed before confirmation.

## Fee Breakdown

Every Trails transaction includes the following fee components:

| Fee Type | Description | Paid To |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Origin Gas** | Gas to execute the transaction on the source chain | Network Validators / Sequencer |
| **Destination Gas** | Gas to execute the transaction on the target chain | Network Validators / Sequencer |
| **Bridge/LP Fees** | Fees charged by the underlying liquidity provider or bridge | Bridge/Liquidity Providers |
| **Trails Protocol Fee** | Small protocol fee that decreases with volume | Trails protocol |

<Info>
All fees are calculated and displayed upfront in the quote. Users see the exact amount they'll pay before confirming any transaction.

## Protocol Fee Structure

The Trails protocol fee uses a volume-based tier system:

- Fees scale **significantly down** as transaction volume increases
- High-volume applications benefit from reduced per-transaction costs
- Fee tiers are calculated based on USD volume transacted

<Note>
For enterprise pricing or high-volume discounts, contact the team.

## Fee Transparency

Trails provides complete fee transparency through:

- **Quote Display**: Full fee breakdown shown before transaction confirmation
- **API Response**: Detailed fee information returned in quote responses (`totalFeeAmountUsdDisplay`)
- **No Hidden Costs**: What you see in the quote is exactly what users pay

## Alternative Gas Tokens

Users can pay gas fees using permit-compatible tokens like USDC or USDT instead of native tokens. See [Pay Gas with Any Token](/architecture/alt-fee-tokens) for details.
