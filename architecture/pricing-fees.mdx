## Fee Model

The protocol is free to integrate for any app. The fee for Trails is paid by the end-user which includes:

- Gas fees on the origin and destination chains
- Included fees for liquidity providers or bridges
- Trails protocol fee which scales significantly down with the amount of volume (in USD) transacted
