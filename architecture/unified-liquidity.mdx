## Overview

Trails acts as an orchestration layer that connects to multiple liquidity sources to find optimal routes for cross-chain transactions. Rather than building its own liquidity pools, Trails aggregates existing infrastructure to provide the best pricing and execution for users.

## Integrated Liquidity Providers

Trails currently integrates with the following liquidity sources:

| Provider | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Circle CCTP** | Bridge | Native USDC bridging with fast finality and no slippage for stablecoin transfers |
| **Relay** | Bridge/Solver | Fast cross-chain transfers with solver-based execution |

## How Liquidity Routing Works

When a user initiates a cross-chain transaction, Trails:

1. **Queries all integrated providers** for available routes and pricing
2. **Evaluates routes** based on speed, cost, and reliability
3. **Selects the optimal path** considering gas costs, bridge fees, and slippage
4. **Executes atomically** through the intent-based architecture

<Tip>
Trails automatically handles fallback routing. If a primary route fails, the system can reroute through alternative providers when possible.
</Tip>

## Adding New Liquidity Sources

Trails is designed with a pluggable architecture that allows new bridges, DEXs, and solvers to be integrated without code changes. New protocols are evaluated based on:

- Security track record and audit status
- Liquidity depth and pricing competitiveness
- Speed and reliability of execution
- Chain coverage and token support

## Benefits of Aggregated Liquidity

- **Best Execution**: Users always get competitive pricing across multiple sources
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure for cross-chain transfers
- **Broad Coverage**: Access to tokens and chains across all integrated providers
- **Future-Proof**: New providers can be added as the ecosystem evolves
