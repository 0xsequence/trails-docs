## Overview

Withdraw mode provides a guided flow for moving assets out of a wallet while keeping fee options and routing handled by Trails. Users can choose the amount to withdraw and the destination token/chain, or you can pre-configure those selections.

**Trade Types**: Supports both `EXACT_INPUT` and `EXACT_OUTPUT` trade types.

## Widget Implementation

### Basic Withdraw Widget

Minimal configuration - users select everything:

```tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

<TrailsWidget
  apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
  mode="withdraw"
  onCheckoutComplete={({ sessionId }) => {
    console.log('Withdrawal completed:', sessionId)
  }}
>
  <button>Withdraw</button>
</TrailsWidget>
```

### Pre-configured Withdraw

Pre-select origin and destination details:

```tsx
<TrailsWidget
  apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
  mode="withdraw"
  fromChainId={1} // Ethereum
  fromToken="USDC"
  defaultToChainId={8453} // Base
  defaultToToken="ETH"
  toAddress="0x97c4A952b46bEcaD0663f76357d3776ba11566E1"
  onCheckoutComplete={({ sessionId }) => {
    console.log('Withdrawal completed:', sessionId)
  }}
>
  <button>Withdraw USDC</button>
</TrailsWidget>
```

<Note>
Recipient inputs accept `.eth` ENS names in the widget UI and resolve them automatically.
