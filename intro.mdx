description: Accept crypto payments in any token, from any chain, with one integration. Built for stablecoin settlements.

## Accept Any Token. Settle in Stablecoins.

Trails is the payment rails layer for crypto. Accept payments from users holding any token on any chain, and settle in USDC, USDT, or your preferred asset—all in a single user confirmation.

```tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

<TrailsWidget
  apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY"
  mode="pay"
  toAddress="0xYourMerchantAddress"
  toAmount="100"
  toChainId={8453} // Base
  toToken="USDC"
/>
// User pays with any token → You receive exactly 100 USDC
```

**No bridging UX. No swap popups. One click.**

## Why Trails?

| Challenge | Trails Solution |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Users hold tokens across 10+ chains | Aggregated balance from all chains in one view |
| Bridging takes minutes and multiple txs | Single confirmation, Trails handles routing |
| Payment failures from insufficient gas | Gasless transactions using USDC/USDT as fee token |
| Complex multi-step checkout flows | 1-click payment with any wallet |

## Core Capabilities

## How It Works

1. **Define payment** — Specify recipient, amount, chain, and token (e.g., 100 USDC on Base)
2. **User selects source** — Trails shows aggregated balance across all chains
3. **One-click execute** — User confirms once; Trails routes swap → bridge → execute

The user's transaction deposits into a Trails *intent address*. Relayers automatically fulfill the destination transaction—no manual bridging or waiting.

## Universal Compatibility

- **Wallets**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rabby, Privy, or any EOA/smart wallet. EIP-7702 not required.
- **Chains**: All major EVM chains. See [supported chains](/resources/supported-chains).
- **Tokens**: USDC, USDT, ETH, and 1000+ tokens across integrated chains.
