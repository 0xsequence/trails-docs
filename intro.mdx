title: What is Trails?
description: The onchain transaction rails for every token from every chain with every wallet with one, aggregated balance - powered by intents.
---


## Overview

Trails is a intent-powered, orchestration protocol that enables 1-click transactions from any wallet seamlessly with unified user liquidity across all chains.
In contrast to typical cross-chain solutions, Trails sources onchain liquidity and aggregates all user balances for every token across every chain in a user's wallet
as options for any transaction. Trails natively integrates and complements existing bridging, filler, or solver infrastructure by sourcing them as liquidity and contributing volume. 

Trails is free to integrate and is optimized for a variety of use cases for the most common flows in crypto, for example:

- **[Pay](/use-cases/pay)**: Enable cross-chain, 1-click payments with any token. Ideal for ecommerce platforms, NFT marketplaces, real-world asset purchases, and minimal-slippage stablecoin transactions.
- **[Swap](/use-cases/swap)**: Embed low-latency, highly liquid cross-chain token swaps for your applications.
- **[Fund](/use-cases/fund)**: Maximize TVL and transaction velocity by funding via fiat or crypto such as perpetual exchanges, prediction markets, and chains. Utilizing our intent address primitive, we are able to support nearly any token or chain - even if the onramp provider doesn't.
- **[Earn](/use-cases/earn)**: Streamline DeFi yield opportunities by enabling deposits into tokenized vaults, lending pools, and yield strategies from any token on any chain already integrated into Trails.

## Key Features

### 1-click Transactions
- Transactions occur in a single confirmation with any wallet, regardless if it's an EOA, account abstraction wallet, or EIP-7702 enabled.
- Developers simply specify payment intent (e.g., "purchase NFT #123 with 30 USDC") and a user can select any token across their wallet balance to pay.

### Universal User Liquidity
- Built-in multichain, realtime indexing to automatically return user's wallet balances, prices, and asset metadata. No third-party dependencies necessary.
- Leveraging existing liquidity infrastructure such as DEX's, bridges, or aggregators, we support a vast array of tokens and chains.

### Simplified Developer and User Experience
- Leverage any permit-compatible token to use as a gas fee end to end such as USDC or USDT.
- Optimized UX flows for core use cases in pay, swap, fund, and earn.
- One-line, drop-in replacement `useTrailsSendTransaction` leveraging wagmi to enable a chain abstraction experience across your entire app.

### Blazing Fast
- Fast from anywhere, even with payments across chains using our intent-based architecture & relayer infrastructure.
- Protocol intelligently detects optimal route for payment fulfillment and presents to the user in a streamlined UX.

### Scalable
- Trails can leverage virtually any existing cross-chain or liquidity infrastructure, including bridges, aggregators, and more.
- Relayer & Indexing infrastructure is lightweight and easily deployable to new chains.

## How Trails Works

Trails introduces a novel 'intent address' primitive powered by account abstraction tech that enables onchain verifiable execution trustlessly. Here's the flow on how it works:

1. **App Defines Intent**: Create a payment transaction (mint, deposit, swap, etc) for any chain in any token.
2. **Trails SDK Inspects**: Can this succeed with the assets held on current chain? Yes = Pass through. No = Continue Orchestration.
3. **User Selects Route**: Trails presents an aggregated balance of the user's assets across all chains for the user to select from.
4. **Trails Orchestrates Transaction**: Intelligently combines and optimizes swap + bridge + execute for the selected route to fulfill the transaction.
5. **Execute Transaction**: User confirms the transaction via their wallet which deposits the amount from their balance into a Trails 'intent address' - Trails handles the rest automatically!

This architecture enables developers to build sophisticated transaction experiences while abstracting the underlying complexity of multichain operations. All you have to do is specify what transaction and any payment options to execute
whether cross or same chain. Developers can pass in calldata to execute any arbitrary smart contract functions.

### Working with Trails

The Trails is complementary to existing cross-chain and chain abstraction infrastructure. It is highly pluggable and leverages various fillers, solvers, DEX's, and bridges for maximum liquidity and low-slippage across a wide variety of tokens and routes. In short, Trails enhances the flow of funds for the underlying infrastructure.

Trails supports any wallets including: EOA wallets such as MetaMask, smart wallets like Coinbase Smart Wallet, and embedded wallets like Privy. Trails supports any EVM-compatible chain
and does not require EIP-7702 enabled wallets. For more information please read our [architecture section](/architecture/how-it-works).
