I want to optimize the trails documentation to make sure it's concise, LLM friendly, and has the various features / use cases that trails supports. importantly the documentation should resonate with the developer so please make sure it is captivating, well-written. You can use the existing trails-docs as a starting point and iterate from there. Also the trails-api and trails folder contains the api and SDK respectively.

Please make sure to use the mintlify framework throughout. You can visit https://trails.build for more info as well. A big focus on the narrative should be on payments and stablecoins. Please investigate things that are missing, analyze things that should be there, but also don't include things that don't need to be external dev facing. Again, we want to tell a story of why trails is the best 1-click chain abstraction orchestrator and make sure we're thorough
